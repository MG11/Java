The folders are numbered in order of how the lessons are structured. Once you navigate into a folder, double click or drag and drop the .htm file to your browser to have it load the page.

The code in the .htm page references the the other files using a relative folder path (so for Queues.htm, it always goes to ./Queues_files/* to get it’s contents).
